Frequently Asked Questions
There are some questions I get asked a lot on the course, so I've copied some of them below. You can see a full list of questions at http://codeschool.org.uk/faq.php - please check there before posting in the forums or emailing.



How do I get the cool free stuff?

This is explained in lecture 4. In short, go to ecowebhosting.co.uk/cp/webdev2 to sign up for the hosting and you'll be given links to all the extras.



Can I download all the course materials?

Each of the course materials is downloadable from the links in the course, but you can also access or download everything at once from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0QJD6cbZvLhVF9lMW9GOWQwQzg.



Can I download the course videos?

Yes, you can download the course videos using the Udemy iPhone/iPad and Android apps. You cannot download the videos to a PC at this time.



I'm having problems playing the videos

Please try using a different browser and/or internet connection. If that doesn't help, please follow these suggestions https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229231227-Video-Playback-Issues and if those suggestions don't help contact Udemy, as I don't control the Udemy website.



How long does my free web hosting last?

Your web hosting lasts for 12 months. This is limited to one year per student, so buying multiple courses will not get you an extra year I'm afraid.




There's a bug/error in one of the videos! What should I do?

I maintain a bug report doc at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xqFnzC80KD5sEC58LjNIBZtJ6gPBcl_32wmaoCMJiTo/edit#gid=0 - please post a comment there under the Web Dev Course 2.0 Issues tab and I'll get to it ASAP.



Please can I have a refund?

Absolutely - you can do this up to 30 days after buying the course through Udemy directly via https://support.udemy.com/customer/portal/articles/1507981-can-i-get-a-refund-?b_id=3056

Now on to the course!
