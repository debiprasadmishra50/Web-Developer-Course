	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<h2>A Few Facts about Earth</h2>
	<img src="earth.jpg" width="500" height="400">
	<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and largest of the terrestrial planets. Surprisingly, while it is only the fifth largest planet in terms of size and mass, it is the densest (5,513 kg/m3) of all the planets. Earth is the only planet in the solar system not named after a mythological being. Instead, its name is derived from the Old English word "ertha" and the Anglo-Saxon word "erda" which means ground or soil.</p> 

	<p>Earth was formed somewhere around 4.54 billion years ago and is currently the only known planet to support life - and lots of it.</p>
